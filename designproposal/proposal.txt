NAME OF PROJECT:
    CrazyWorld
DESCRIPTION:
    A 2d action role-playing game
Competitive Analysis:
    I have seen other games in the same genre, such as the Legend of Zelda, Undertale, etc. I
    wanted to make a game that had the same visual aesthetic but a difference in terms of gameplay mechanics.
    Like the Legend of Zelda and unlike Undertale, combat would progress in real-time; however,
    unlike the Legend of Zelda, enemies would be harder to defeat. In some cases, dodging attacks and
    quick-time events would be the key to avoiding a game over.
Structural Plan:
    I will be writing custom modules dedicated to handling player and npc stats, as well as certain attacks
    a player or npc has. Creating different tiles such as water, cloud, and ice as well as grass could be handled as well.

Algorithmic Plan:
    I will also write AI algorithms for different npcs. The npcs cannot be unintelligent and easily defeated
    by the player. Instead the player must react quickly to npc's attacks and either dodge or parry the attack.
    The enemies must be hard, but not impossible, to defeat. "Alpha testing" the enemies to ensure
    that they are not over-powered in any way and make sure that they are not too easy to defeat will be key.

Timelime Plan:
    I will finish most of the more intermediate features on Tuesday, and bring out most of the final work by Thursday.

Version Control Plan:
    I will be using git version control (via github.com) to backup my project.

# TP2 Update
    I actually realized that my work was becoming more of an endless
    game, so I decided to change the gameplay into more of an endless
    survival for simplicity.
